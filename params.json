Even though we have had may classic solutions to get the shortest path in a graph, most of the algorithms cannot be applied in finding the longest path, except Floyd Algorithm and Dynamic Programming. Since we need to print out the path in this question, Dynamic Programming is better than Floyd Algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple java project, and can be compiled by any Java IDE.\r\n\r\n###Big-O analysis: \r\npublic static void getNameChain(String[] names){\r\n\t for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {\t         O(N)\r\n            ……\r\n        recursive(names, 1);\r\n            ……\r\n       }\r\n}\r\nstatic void recursive(String[] part, int offset) {\t\tO(N+N)\r\n    if (offset > maxPathLength) {//record longest name chain each time\r\n        ……\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < offset; i++) {\t\t\t\tO(N)\r\n            maxPathExample.append(\" \" + getLastChar(part[i]));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    String lastChar = getLastChar(part[offset - 1]);\r\n    for (int i = offset; i < part.length; i++) {\t\t\tO(N)\r\n        if (getFirstChar(part[i]).equals(lastChar)) {\r\n        ……\r\n            recursive(names, offset+1);\t\t\t\tO(N)\r\n        ……\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nTime: O(N) = O(N^3);\r\nMemory: O(N) = O(N);\r\n\r\nI have tried to optimize the time complexity and memory complexity. I give up the solution at last because it may cost much more time to rewrite the whole algorithm, but I will work on that in the future.\r\n\r\n###Test:\r\nYou can find the test code in src file.\r\nHere are the results.\r\nThe program can get the correct result of given example:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    maximum path length        : 4\r\n    example path of that length: Lebron James Elton John Lennon</code>\r\n\r\nI used the subset of UCI Machine Learning Repository Movie Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Movie). And cleaned them with R. The input file is “CeleName.txt”, and the screen shot of output is as follow:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    maximum path length        : 10\r\n    example path of that length: Crane Randolph Anders Glenn Scott Newman Barry Patrick Lee Bill Tony</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
